Sooner or later all of my students step into learning [Git](//git-scm.com). It's pretty obvious. I can't really imagine situation in which a person wanting to become a programmer (of any programming language(s)) would not need to learn and use a <accr title="Version Control System">VCS</accr>. And `git` gained its high position in this area for a reason.

I also noticed that roughly one on four of my students would asked me a question like:

> "Why do I need to do 
>
> `git add`
>
>  command and then follow with the 
>
> `git commit`
>
> ?!
>
> What's the real life purpose of that?!"

The short answer is: You don't actually have to (but you often should)

The longer answer is all based on one word: _control_.
