I really like the [CSS Day](https://cssday.nl) Conference, organised in Amsterdam since 2013,
although I've never been to any in person.

I was recently viewing new videos from the 2018 edition published on their official
[Vimeo Channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/cssday). I got so inspired,
that I decided to also remind myself some older speeches.

And here's one, I'd like to comment on&hellip; well actually, only a 1m 22s fragment&hellip; ;) 
<!-- more -->

In this short fragment of Vasilis van Gemert's speech (from 36:48 up to 38:10)
author raises very important topic, which in my opinion should be repeated and
"evangelised" until it brings about change into the programming industry.

The issue is&hellip; **loads of talented women are giving up with boosting and/or using
their true technical skills in favour of more design-related or other positions.**  

I hadn't realised the problem before, but then, at the beginning of the year 2018,
I started to teach programming and was given an opportunity to meet some very talented women.

Sadly, I have also noticed this worrysome "trend" which Vasilis mentions -- almost half of
my female students didn't feel "good enough" (whatever that means) to continue and look for
programming positions. 

That's a shame. That's a sad and disappointing fact.

So let me send out a short appeal to women all over the world:

**Ladies! Don't hesitate to enter this, so called, "man's world"!
Don't be afraid to turn it upside down if needed!
Do, what you feel you like to do! Evolve, progress and expand!
Make this world yours also!**

Thank you!

PS. I recommend watching the whole Vasilis' talk because it's brilliant ;)
