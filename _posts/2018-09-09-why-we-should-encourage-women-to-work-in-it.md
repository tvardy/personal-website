I really like the [CSS Day](https://cssday.nl) Conference, organised in Amsterdam since 2013,
although I've never been on any in person.

I was recently reviewing new videos from 2018 edition published on their official
[Vimeo Channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/cssday). I got so into the climate of the encounter,
that I decided also to remind some older speeches.

And here's one that I'd like to comment on&hellip; well actually, only a 1m 22s fragment&hellip; ;) 
<!-- more -->

In this short fragment of Vasilis van Gemert's speech (from 36:48 up to 38:10)
there's a very important topic raised, which in my opinion should be repeated and
"evangelised" until it brings a change into programming industry.

The issue is&hellip; **loads of talented women are giving up with powering up and/or using
their true technical skills in favour of more design-related or anything-else-related positions.**  

I didn't realise the problem before, but then, at the beginning of the year 2018,
I started to teach programming and was given an opportunity to meet some very talented women.

Sadly, I have also noticed this "trend" which Vasilis mentions -- almost half of my female
students didn't feel "good enough" (whatever that means) to continue and look for
programming positions. 

That's a pity. That's a terrible pity.

So let me shout out a short appeal to women all over the world:

**Gals! Don't hesitate to enter this, so called, "men's world"! Don't be afraid to turn it upside down if needed!
Do, what you feel, you like to do! Evolve, progress and expand! Make this world also yours!**

Thank you!

PS. I recommend watching the whole Vasilis' talk because it's brilliant ;)
