My name is Greg. I'm a full-stack JS developer living and working in Poland.

Besides being a senior developer in an International Corporation I also happen to be a programming mentor @ [Kodilla.com](https://kodilla.com) and self-employed JS contractor plus  Scrum Master / Scrum Evangelist.

On this website, I'm trying to gather some interesting issues I faced myself or have been faced by students asking questions or making smaller or bigger mistakes on their travel into the magical Web Development World ;)

If you want to know more about me and my work check out the [Projects](/projects) and [Resume](/resume) pages.

If you'd like to contact me, then reach me by my [LinkedIn profile](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/grzegorz-twardowski-7b1082b2).
