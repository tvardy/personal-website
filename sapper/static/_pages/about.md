## ... author

My name is Greg. I'm a full-stack JS developer living and working in Poland.

Besides being a senior developer in an International Corporation I also happen to be
a programming mentor @ [Kodilla.com](https://kodilla.com) and self-employed JS contractor
plus Scrum Master / Scrum Evangelist.

If you want to know more about me and my work check out the [Projects](/projects)
and [Resume](/resume) pages. (Sorry... WIP there ;))

If you'd like to contact me, then reach me by
my [LinkedIn profile](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/grzegorz-twardowski-7b1082b2).


## ... this site

On this website, I'm trying to gather some interesting issues I faced myself
or have been faced by students asking questions or making smaller or bigger mistakes
on their travel into the magical Web Development World ;)

This website is also [open-sourced](https://github.com/tvardy/personal-website), mostly
having my beloved past, current and future students in mind, to be an example of
git workflow (eg. branching, standardised commit messages, pull requests),
and other good practices (contributing to open-source in general, using other
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) tools,
continuous integration, continuous deployment and whatever else I'll get an idea).
